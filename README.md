🖐️ AI Hand Gesture Controller for Game & UI Interaction 🎮🖱️
This project uses AI-based hand gesture recognition to control both games like Subway Surfers and basic UI navigation (such as scrolling) using only hand gestures detected by your webcam.

🔍 Description
Using MediaPipe and OpenCV, this Python project detects real-time hand landmarks and interprets them into actions such as:

✋ Jump — when the index and middle fingers are raised above the thumb

👈 Left — when the index finger moves to the left of the thumb

👉 Right — when the index finger moves to the right of the thumb

📜 Scroll Down — when the index and middle fingers are positioned below the wrist

These gestures are converted into keyboard or mouse actions using pyautogui, letting you control games and scroll web pages hands-free!
